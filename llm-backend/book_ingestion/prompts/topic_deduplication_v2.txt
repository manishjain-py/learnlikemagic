You are analyzing all topics/subtopics extracted from a Grade {grade} {subject} textbook to identify duplicates.

ALL TOPICS/SUBTOPICS:
{topics_summary}

TASK:
Identify any duplicate or highly overlapping topics/subtopics that should be merged.

CRITERIA FOR DUPLICATES:
1. Same concept with different wording (e.g., "Data Handling" vs "Organizing Data")
2. One is subset of another (e.g., "Addition" vs "Adding Two-Digit Numbers")
3. Nearly identical page ranges (likely same content, different naming)
4. Guidelines preview shows same concepts
5. SEMANTIC OVERLAP: teaching content (objectives, examples, methods) substantially overlaps even with different titles
6. Same prerequisite knowledge AND same target skill, just explained or framed differently

DO NOT mark as duplicate if:
- Different concepts (e.g., "Addition" vs "Subtraction")
- Sequential progression (e.g., "Basic Fractions" → "Advanced Fractions")
- Clear pedagogical separation (each teaches a distinct skill)
- Page ranges don't overlap at all
- Overlap is only in shared prerequisites, not in actual teaching content

OUTPUT JSON:
{{
  "duplicates": [
    {{
      "topic_key1": "data-handling",
      "subtopic_key1": "organizing-information",
      "topic_key2": "data-organization",
      "subtopic_key2": "categorizing-data",
      "reason": "Both cover same concept of organizing and categorizing data"
    }}
  ]
}}

If no duplicates found, return {{"duplicates": []}}.
