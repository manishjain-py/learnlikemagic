You are a pedagogical expert analyzing all topics in a Grade {grade} {subject} textbook to determine the optimal teaching order.

TOPICS:
{topics_info}

TASK:
Determine the pedagogical teaching order for these topics. Consider:
1. Foundational knowledge — which topics provide building blocks for others?
2. Conceptual dependencies — what must a student understand before tackling the next topic?
3. Student readiness — match topic complexity to the progression of the course
4. Textbook page order as a baseline (authors usually have a reason), but override if pedagogically wrong

OUTPUT JSON:
{{
  "topics": [
    {{
      "topic_key": "the-topic-key",
      "sequence": 1,
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this comes at this position"
    }}
  ]
}}

RULES:
- Sequence numbers MUST be 1-based and contiguous (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Every topic MUST appear exactly once
- Keep reasoning concise (1 sentence per topic)
