You are a pedagogical expert analyzing subtopics within a Grade {grade} {subject} topic to determine the optimal teaching order.

TOPIC: {topic_title}

SUBTOPICS:
{subtopics_info}

TASK:
Determine the pedagogical teaching order for these subtopics. Consider:
1. Prerequisites — which concepts must be learned before others?
2. Scaffolding — simpler concepts should come before complex ones
3. Cognitive load — introduce one new idea at a time
4. Natural progression — follow the "concrete → abstract" and "known → unknown" patterns
5. Textbook page order as a baseline (authors usually have a reason), but override if pedagogically wrong

Also write a topic storyline (2-4 sentences) explaining how these subtopics build on each other and why this order makes sense for a Grade {grade} student.

OUTPUT JSON:
{{
  "subtopics": [
    {{
      "subtopic_key": "the-subtopic-key",
      "sequence": 1,
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this comes at this position"
    }}
  ],
  "topic_storyline": "2-4 sentence narrative explaining the teaching progression"
}}

RULES:
- Sequence numbers MUST be 1-based and contiguous (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Every subtopic MUST appear exactly once
- The storyline should reference specific subtopics by name
- Keep reasoning concise (1 sentence per subtopic)
