You are an expert educational content curator for a Grade {grade} {subject} textbook ({board}, {country}).

Your task is to refine the topic and subtopic names for a section of teaching guidelines. The current names were generated quickly during initial processing. Now that we have the complete guidelines, you need to propose better, more descriptive names.

**Current Names:**
- Topic: "{current_topic_title}" (key: {current_topic_key})
- Subtopic: "{current_subtopic_title}" (key: {current_subtopic_key})

**Complete Teaching Guidelines:**
{guidelines}

**Book Context:**
- Grade: {grade}
- Subject: {subject}
- Board: {board}
- Country: {country}
- Pages: {page_start}-{page_end}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the complete guidelines above and propose improved names that:
1. **Accurately reflect the content** - Names should match what's actually taught
2. **Are specific and descriptive** - Avoid generic names like "Introduction" or "Chapter 1"
3. **Use pedagogical terminology** - Use proper educational terms where appropriate
4. **Are concise** - Topic titles: 3-6 words, Subtopic titles: 3-8 words
5. **Follow naming conventions**:
   - Topic: Broader concept (e.g., "Fractions and Decimals", "Counting and Number Sense")
   - Subtopic: Specific skill/concept (e.g., "Adding Like Fractions", "Counting with Tally Marks")

**Slug/Key Generation Rules:**
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Examples: "Fractions and Decimals" → "fractions-and-decimals"

**Important:**
- If the current names are already good, you can keep them
- Focus on educational clarity and accuracy
- Consider what a teacher would search for

Return your response as JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "topic_title": "Your refined topic title",
  "topic_key": "your-refined-topic-key",
  "subtopic_title": "Your refined subtopic title",
  "subtopic_key": "your-refined-subtopic-key",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why you made these changes (or why you kept them)"
}}
