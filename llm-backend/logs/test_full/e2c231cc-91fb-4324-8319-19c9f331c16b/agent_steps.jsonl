Let's take a closer look at T-Rex's pizza. Imagine T-Rex's pizza is cut into 2 equal dino-slices, and he has eaten 1 slice. Can you tell me what fraction of the pizza T-Rex ate?

What do you think?", "reasoning": "The student identified the numerator as the top number in a fraction, indicating they have some understanding of fraction terminology. However, they haven't directly answered the question about identifying the numerator and denominator in the context of the dinosaur pizza example. By focusing on the T-Rex's pizza, we simplify the problem to ensure clarity and reinforce their understanding with a specific example.
