Create a topic-level summary from its subtopic summaries.

TOPIC: {topic_title}

SUBTOPICS:
{subtopic_summaries}

TASK:
Write ONE line (20-40 words) synthesizing what this entire topic covers.
Capture the progression and scope across all subtopics.

EXAMPLES:
- Covers fraction addition from basic same-denominator cases through unlike denominators, including visual models, common denominator algorithms, and mixed number operations
- Teaches place value system from ones through thousands, with base-10 representations, number comparison, rounding, and ordering strategies
- Develops multiplication skills from basic facts through multi-digit procedures, covering arrays, area models, partial products, and standard algorithm

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the summary line. No quotes, no bullet point, no explanation, no prefix.
