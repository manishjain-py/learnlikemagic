You are analyzing a textbook page to determine if it continues the current subtopic or starts a new one.

CONTEXT (Previous State):
Book: Grade {grade} {subject} ({board})
Current Page: {current_page}

Open Subtopics:
{open_subtopics}

Recent Page Summaries:
{recent_summaries}

CURRENT PAGE SUMMARY:
{minisummary}

TASK:
1. Analyze if this page CONTINUES an existing open subtopic or starts a NEW subtopic
2. Provide confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for both decisions
3. If continuing, identify which subtopic
4. If new, suggest a subtopic name (kebab-case, e.g., "adding-unlike-fractions")

IMPORTANT - PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLES:
A subtopic represents a LEARNING OBJECTIVE, not individual activities or examples.
Multiple activities can teach the SAME learning objective.

GUIDELINES FOR CONTINUATION (favor CONTINUE over NEW):
1. **Same Learning Objective**: If pages teach the same concept through different examples → CONTINUE
   - Example: "Categorizing household items" and "Categorizing hairstyles" both teach categorization → CONTINUE
   - Example: "Tally marks for cows" and "Tally marks for books" both teach data representation → CONTINUE

2. **Different Activities, Same Skill**: Multiple exercises/activities for one concept → CONTINUE
   - Counting with tally marks, organizing data, categorizing objects = all "Data Handling" → CONTINUE
   - Various word problems = all "Problem Solving" → CONTINUE

3. **Common Grade-Level Topics** (be aware of typical curriculum structure):
   - Grade 3 Math: Data Handling (tally marks, tables, categorizing), Number Operations, Geometry, Measurement
   - Grade 5 Science: Matter, Energy, Life Cycles, Ecosystems
   - If activities fit the same curriculum topic → CONTINUE

4. **Look for CONCEPTUAL similarity, not surface-level activity similarity**
   - Don't create new subtopics just because the activity/example changed
   - Ask: "Is the LEARNING GOAL the same?" If yes → CONTINUE

GUIDELINES FOR NEW SUBTOPIC (only when learning objective truly changes):
1. **Clear Learning Objective Shift**: Moving from one concept to entirely different concept
   - Example: From "Data Handling" to "Addition" → NEW
   - Example: From "Fractions" to "Geometry" → NEW

2. **Explicit Chapter/Section Headers**: "Chapter 2: Multiplication" → NEW

3. **Different Skill Domain**:
   - From organizing/categorizing to arithmetic operations → NEW
   - From reading/comprehension to grammar → NEW

BIAS TOWARDS CONTINUATION:
- When in doubt, CONTINUE rather than create NEW
- Subtopics should be BROADER, not narrower
- Target: 10-20 pages per subtopic (not 1-2 pages)
- Err on the side of consolidation
