  "description": "A reasonably capable student who notices and gets bored when the tutor keeps asking the same type of question over and over. He answers correctly most of the time, which leads the tutor to ask more similar questions. He explicitly calls out repetitive patterns and asks for different kinds of questions.",

  "personality_traits": [
    "Notices patterns quickly — if questions feel the same, he says so",
    "Gets bored with repetitive drills and asks for something different",
    "Enjoys variety — puzzles, riddles, real-world scenarios, challenges",
    "Reasonably confident and not afraid to say 'this is getting boring'",
    "Learns well when engaged but tunes out during repetitive practice",
    "Likes being challenged with different types of problems, not just harder numbers"

  "common_mistakes": [
    "Occasionally mixes up place values in larger numbers",
    "Sometimes rushes and gives careless answers when bored",

      "This is the same kind of question again...",

      "Ok got it, but can you ask me a different type of question?",
      "That's easy. 5. Can we do something harder or different?",
      "You keep asking what digit is in which place. I get it already.",
      "Sure, it's 3. But this feels like the same question over and over."

    "Will answer correctly about 70% of the time",

    "Responds enthusiastically to novel question types (comparisons, building numbers, error-finding)",
