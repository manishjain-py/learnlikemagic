## 📊 Database Schema

### New Tables

**books**
```sql
id, title, author, edition, edition_year,
country, board, grade, subject,
cover_image_s3_key, s3_prefix, metadata_s3_key,
status, created_at, updated_at, created_by
```

**book_guidelines**
```sql
id, book_id, guideline_s3_key,
status, generated_at, reviewed_at, reviewed_by, version
```

### Modified Tables

**teaching_guidelines** (Phases 1-5 additions)
```sql
book_id           # Reference to source book
source_pages      # JSON array: [15, 16, 17]
```

**teaching_guidelines** (Phase 6 additions - NEW SCHEMA)
```sql
-- Key identifiers (slugified for programmatic access)
topic_key VARCHAR NOT NULL          -- e.g., "fractions"
subtopic_key VARCHAR NOT NULL       -- e.g., "adding-like-fractions"

-- Structured metadata (separate JSON columns)
objectives_json TEXT                -- JSON array of learning objectives
examples_json TEXT                  -- JSON array of worked examples
misconceptions_json TEXT            -- JSON array of common errors
assessments_json TEXT               -- JSON array of assessment items

-- Core teaching field (NEW: first-class field)
teaching_description TEXT NOT NULL  -- 3-6 lines, complete teaching approach

-- Source tracking (enhanced)
source_page_start INTEGER           -- First page of subtopic
source_page_end INTEGER             -- Last page of subtopic
evidence_summary TEXT               -- Brief content summary

-- Metadata
status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'draft'      -- draft|final
confidence FLOAT                    -- 0.0-1.0 (boundary detection confidence)
version INTEGER DEFAULT 1           -- For tracking updates

-- New indices
CREATE INDEX idx_teaching_guidelines_keys ON teaching_guidelines(topic_key, subtopic_key);
```

**Rationale for New Schema:**
- `topic_key`/`subtopic_key`: Slugified keys enable programmatic lookups
- Separate JSON columns: Easier to query specific metadata types
- `teaching_description`: Single field AI tutor can read without parsing nested structure
- Enhanced source tracking: Know exact page ranges for provenance

## ⏳ Remaining Work

### Phase 6: Guideline Extraction (Sharded, Incremental Pipeline) (~14 hours)

**IMPORTANT:** Comprehensive design document available at:
`docs/features/book-to-curriculum-guide-mapping/phase6-guideline-extraction-design.md`

- ✅ Per-subtopic sharded storage (`.latest.json` files)
- ✅ Context Pack for token efficiency (98% reduction)
- ✅ Teaching description as first-class field
- ✅ Boundary detection with hysteresis
- ❌ No reconciliation window (deferred to v2)
- ❌ No event sourcing (deferred to v2)
- ❌ No embeddings (LLM-only sufficient for MVP)

**Phase 6a: Core Pipeline** (~6 hours)
- [ ] Data model schemas (JSON) - 0.5 hours
- [ ] S3 layout setup - 0.5 hours
- [ ] Minisummary generator - 1 hour
- [ ] Context Pack builder - 1.5 hours
- [ ] Boundary detector (LLM-only) - 1.5 hours
- [ ] Facts extractor - 1 hour

**Phase 6b: State Management** (~3 hours)
- [ ] Reducer (deterministic merge) - 1.5 hours
- [ ] Stability detector - 0.5 hours
- [ ] Index management (index.json, page_index.json) - 1 hour

**Phase 6c: Quality & Sync** (~2 hours)
- [ ] Teaching description generator - 1 hour
- [ ] Quality gates - 0.5 hours
- [ ] DB sync with new schema - 0.5 hours

**Phase 6d: Admin UI** (~3 hours)
- [ ] Guideline review page - 1.5 hours
- [ ] Progress indicator - 0.5 hours
- [ ] Approve/regenerate controls - 1 hour

### Phase 7: Testing & Integration (~2 hours)
- [ ] Unit tests for all 9 components
- [ ] Integration test with 10-page sample book
- [ ] End-to-end test with real NCERT Math Magic book (50+ pages)
- [ ] Verify complete workflow (upload → OCR → guidelines → DB)
- [ ] Test AI tutor integration with new guidelines
- [ ] Performance testing (< 10 minutes, < $0.05 cost)
- [ ] Quality metrics (> 85% boundary accuracy, > 90% quality gate pass rate)
- [ ] Bug fixes

- **Storage:** AWS S3 (images + metadata)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (existing)

### ✅ Security & Quality
- Input validation at every layer
- Proper error handling with HTTP status codes
- AWS credentials auto-detection (no hardcoding)
- Image format/size validation
- Type safety (TypeScript + Pydantic)

### ✅ User Experience
- Side-by-side OCR review (image + text)
- Drag-and-drop upload
- Real-time status updates
- Clear error messages
- Responsive design

## 📈 Metrics & Performance

### Current Performance
- **Page Upload:** < 3 seconds (image upload to S3)
- **OCR Processing:** 5-10 seconds per page
- **UI Response:** Real-time updates
- **Database Queries:** Indexed for fast lookups

### Scalability Considerations
- S3 storage: Virtually unlimited
- Database: Indexed on curriculum fields
- API: Async operations where possible

## 🆕 Recent Updates

### October 27, 2025: Phase 6 Design Complete

**Major design evolution:** From simple sequential pipeline to sophisticated sharded architecture

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Sharded Storage Architecture**
   - One `.latest.json` file per subtopic (not one giant guideline.json)
   - Enables per-subtopic concurrency (future)
   - Smaller files = faster reads/writes, easier debugging
   - Storage structure: `guidelines/topics/{topic}/subtopics/{subtopic}.latest.json`

2. **Context Pack: 98% Token Reduction**
   - Problem: Processing page 50 requires 24,500 tokens (all previous pages)
   - Solution: Distill history into ~300 token Context Pack
   - Contains: open subtopics summary + last 2 page summaries + ToC hints
   - Result: 50x cheaper and faster LLM calls

3. **Teaching Description as First-Class Field**
   - Instead of nested metadata, generate single 3-6 line field
   - Contains everything needed to teach: concept, sequence, misconceptions, checks
   - AI tutor reads ONE field instead of parsing complex structure
   - Generated when subtopic stabilizes

4. **Boundary Detection with Hysteresis**
   - Prevents "boundary flapping" (rapid switching between continue/new)
   - Hysteresis zone (0.6-0.75) for ambiguous cases
   - LLM-only for MVP v1 (embeddings deferred to v2)

5. **Database Schema Adoption**
   - Decided to adopt new schema with topic_key/subtopic_key
   - Separate JSON columns for objectives/examples/misconceptions/assessments
   - Enhanced source tracking (page ranges, evidence summary)

**MVP v1 Scope Decision:**
- ✅ Include: Sharded storage, Context Pack, teaching descriptions, hysteresis
- ❌ Defer to v2: Reconciliation window, event sourcing, embeddings
- Target: 14 hours implementation, <10 min processing time, <$0.05 cost per book

**Documentation:**
- Created comprehensive Phase 6 design document (75+ pages)
- Updated implementation-plan.txt with new approach
- Updated IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md with Phase 6 details

### October 26, 2025: Approved Page Management Enhancement

- ✅ Added PageViewPanel component for viewing approved pages
- ✅ Implemented side-by-side display of page image and OCR text
- ✅ Added Replace Page functionality (delete + upload workflow)
- ✅ Added Delete Page with automatic sequential renumbering
- ✅ Implemented three-mode interface: upload/view/replace
- ✅ Updated PageService to renumber pages after deletion

**User Impact:**
- Admins can now click any approved page to view it
- Pages can be replaced if OCR quality is poor
- Pages can be deleted with automatic renumbering (no gaps)
- Better page management and quality control
