# Learning Session

A learning session is a one-on-one conversation between a student and the AI tutor on a specific topic. The platform offers three session modes: **Teach Me** (structured lesson), **Clarify Doubts** (student-led Q&A), and **Exam** (knowledge test).

---

## Starting a Session

1. **Pick a subject** — Choose from available subjects (e.g., Mathematics, English)
2. **Pick a topic** — Choose a topic within that subject (e.g., Fractions)
3. **Pick a subtopic** — Choose a specific subtopic (e.g., Comparing Fractions)
   - Subtopics show progress badges if you've studied them before: a check mark for mastered, a dot for in progress, along with a percentage score
4. **Pick a mode** — Choose how you want to learn:
   - **Teach Me** — Learn the topic from scratch with a structured lesson
   - **Clarify Doubts** — Ask questions about the topic and get direct answers
   - **Exam** — Test your knowledge with a set of questions
5. **Resume (if available)** — If you have a paused Teach Me session for this subtopic, a "Resume" option appears at the top of the mode selection, showing your coverage percentage so you can pick up where you left off
6. **Start learning** — The tutor greets you and begins

You can also start a session from the scorecard by tapping "Practice Again" on any subtopic.

## Learning Modes

### Teach Me

A structured lesson where the tutor follows a study plan, explains concepts, asks questions, and tracks your mastery. This is the primary learning mode.

See the detailed sections below for how the tutor teaches, session progression, and mastery tracking.

#### Pausing and Resuming

You can pause a Teach Me session at any time using the "Pause Session" button. When you pause:
- Your progress is saved, including which specific concepts you've covered
- A coverage summary tells you how far you got (e.g., "You've covered 60% so far") along with the list of concepts covered
- Next time you select the same subtopic, you can resume from where you left off
- Your full conversation history is restored when you resume

### Clarify Doubts

A student-led Q&A session where you ask questions and the tutor answers them directly. Unlike Teach Me, there is no structured plan — you drive the conversation.

- The tutor answers questions directly without Socratic scaffolding
- After answering, the tutor may ask a brief follow-up to check your understanding
- If a question reveals a deep misunderstanding, the tutor addresses it
- If you seem unsure what to ask, the tutor suggests related areas to explore
- The concepts you discuss are tracked and shown as tags in the session header
- You can end the session at any time using the "End Session" button
- You can also end the session naturally by saying something like "I'm done", "no more doubts", or "that's all" — the tutor will wrap up warmly without asking further questions
- After resolving a doubt, the tutor asks if you have more questions or would like to end — it does not keep adding extra teaching questions
- Past discussions for the same subtopic are available so you can see what you've already asked about

### Exam

A knowledge test with a set of questions (typically 7) covering the subtopic's concepts. The exam assesses what you know without teaching.

- Questions span three difficulty levels: easy (~30%), medium (~50%), and hard (~20%)
- Questions cover different types: conceptual, procedural, and application
- After each answer, the tutor gives brief feedback (1-2 sentences) — it does not teach or remediate
- Answers are scored as correct, partially correct, or incorrect
- Your score is tracked as you go: you can see how many questions you've answered and how many are correct
- You can end the exam early using the "End Exam Early" button and still get your results
- At the end, you see a results summary with:
  - Score and percentage
  - Strengths (concepts you got right)
  - Weak areas (concepts to review)
  - Patterns (overall performance observations)
  - Suggested next steps (e.g., "Review these concepts in Teach Me")

## How the Tutor Teaches

The tutor is designed to feel like a real, caring teacher — not a chatbot. These principles apply primarily to Teach Me mode.

### Teaching Philosophy

1. **Start simple** — Every explanation begins with one core idea and a relatable example. Complexity builds only after you show understanding.

2. **Advance when ready** — When you demonstrate mastery, the tutor moves on. If you ask for harder material, it skips ahead. Strong students aren't held back.

3. **Guide discovery** — When you get something wrong, the tutor doesn't just give the answer:
   - First wrong answer → asks a guiding question
   - Second wrong answer → gives a targeted hint
   - Third wrong answer → explains directly, trying a completely different approach
   - Fourth+ wrong answer → steps back to a simpler prerequisite skill or breaks the problem into smaller pieces
   - If the same misconception keeps recurring, the tutor names it explicitly and creates a targeted exercise
   - If repeated errors reveal you lack a foundational skill, the tutor pauses the topic, drills that skill first, then returns to the original topic

4. **Never repeat** — The tutor varies how it explains things and the types of questions it asks. If something isn't working, it changes strategy.

5. **Match your energy** — If you use examples or metaphors, the tutor builds on them. If you're curious, it feeds that curiosity. If you go off-topic, it gently redirects. If you raise an unexpected idea (even a wrong one), the tutor explores why you think that before dismissing it.

6. **Be real** — Praise is calibrated to difficulty. Easy answers don't get over-the-top celebration. Genuine breakthroughs get genuine enthusiasm. No stock phrases or excessive emojis.

7. **End naturally** — When the lesson is done, the tutor checks if you want to continue. If you say goodbye, it wraps up warmly in a few sentences.

8. **Personalized** — If you've set up a profile (name, age, interests), the tutor uses your name and adapts its examples and language to your age level.

## Session Progression

Each Teach Me session follows a study plan made up of steps:

- **Explain** steps — The tutor introduces a concept
- **Check** steps — The tutor asks questions to verify understanding
- **Practice** steps — The tutor gives problems to solve

The tutor tracks your mastery of each concept as you go. A progress bar shows your current step, and a coverage bar shows how much of the topic you've covered.

### Mastery Tracking

As you answer questions, the tutor updates your mastery score:
- Wrong answers → lower mastery (~30%)
- Partial understanding → moderate mastery (~60%)
- Correct answers → high mastery (~80%)
- Correct answers with reasoning → near-full mastery (~95%)

### Coverage Tracking

Coverage measures how many of the subtopic's concepts you've encountered during the session (as a percentage). This is different from mastery — you can have high coverage but low mastery if you've seen all the concepts but haven't mastered them. Coverage is particularly useful when pausing and resuming sessions.

### Misconception Detection

If the tutor notices a pattern of misunderstanding (e.g., thinking a bigger denominator means a bigger fraction), it identifies the misconception and addresses it directly — sometimes by pausing the current topic to fill a prerequisite gap.

## Ending a Session

### Teach Me

A Teach Me session ends when:
- All study plan steps are completed and mastery is sufficient
- You pause the session to come back later
- The tutor checks if you'd like to continue or stop

After the session, you see a summary with:
- Steps completed
- Overall mastery score
- Any misconceptions that were addressed
- Suggestions for next steps

Advanced students who finish early can continue beyond the study plan for additional practice (up to 10 extra turns).

### Clarify Doubts

A Clarify Doubts session ends when:
- You tap the "End Session" button
- You tell the tutor you're done (e.g., "no more doubts", "that's all")

After the session, you see the list of concepts you discussed.

### Exam

An Exam session ends when:
- You answer all the questions
- You tap the "End Exam Early" button

After the session, you see a results summary with your score, strengths, weak areas, and suggested next steps.

### After Any Session

From the session completion screen, you can start a new session or view your scorecard to see overall progress.

## Key Details

- Sessions are saved automatically — you can review past sessions in your history
- Each session focuses on one subtopic for depth over breadth
- The tutor adapts its response length to match yours — shorter responses for quiet students, more detail for expressive ones
- If the tutor detects you're disengaging (responses getting shorter), it adjusts its approach
- When you change your answer, the tutor asks what made you change before evaluating
- When you use an unexpected strategy, the tutor explores your reasoning before correcting
