# Learning Session

A learning session is a one-on-one conversation between a student and the AI tutor on a specific topic. The tutor follows a study plan, adapts to the student's understanding, and guides them to mastery.

## Starting a Session

1. **Pick a subject** — Choose from available subjects (e.g., Mathematics, English)
2. **Pick a topic** — Choose a topic within that subject (e.g., Fractions)
3. **Pick a subtopic** — Choose a specific subtopic (e.g., Comparing Fractions)
   - Subtopics show progress badges if you've studied them before: a check mark for mastered, a dot for in progress
4. **Start learning** — The tutor greets you and begins the lesson

You can also start a session from the scorecard by tapping "Practice Again" on any subtopic.

## How the Tutor Teaches

The tutor is designed to feel like a real, caring teacher — not a chatbot. Here's how it works:

### Teaching Philosophy

1. **Start simple** — Every explanation begins with one core idea and a relatable example. Complexity builds only after you show understanding.

2. **Advance when ready** — When you demonstrate mastery, the tutor moves on. If you ask for harder material, it skips ahead. Strong students aren't held back.

3. **Guide discovery** — When you get something wrong, the tutor doesn't just give the answer:
   - First wrong answer → asks a guiding question
   - Second wrong answer → gives a targeted hint
   - Third+ wrong answer → explains directly
   - If the same mistake keeps happening, the tutor tries a completely different approach

4. **Never repeat** — The tutor varies how it explains things and the types of questions it asks. If something isn't working, it changes strategy.

5. **Match your energy** — If you use examples or metaphors, the tutor builds on them. If you're curious, it feeds that curiosity. If you go off-topic, it gently redirects.

6. **Be real** — Praise is calibrated to difficulty. Easy answers don't get over-the-top celebration. Genuine breakthroughs get genuine enthusiasm. No stock phrases or excessive emojis.

7. **End naturally** — When the lesson is done, the tutor checks if you want to continue. If you say goodbye, it wraps up warmly in a few sentences.

## Session Progression

Each session follows a study plan made up of steps:

- **Explain** steps — The tutor introduces a concept
- **Check** steps — The tutor asks questions to verify understanding
- **Practice** steps — The tutor gives problems to solve

The tutor tracks your mastery of each concept as you go. A progress bar shows your current step and overall mastery percentage.

### Mastery Tracking

As you answer questions, the tutor updates your mastery score:
- Wrong answers → lower mastery (~30%)
- Partial understanding → moderate mastery (~60%)
- Correct answers → high mastery (~80%)
- Correct answers with reasoning → near-full mastery (~95%)

### Misconception Detection

If the tutor notices a pattern of misunderstanding (e.g., thinking a bigger denominator means a bigger fraction), it identifies the misconception and addresses it directly — sometimes by pausing the current topic to fill a prerequisite gap.

## Ending a Session

A session ends when:
- All study plan steps are completed and mastery is sufficient
- The tutor checks if you'd like to continue or stop

After the session, you see a summary with:
- Steps completed
- Overall mastery score
- Any misconceptions that were addressed
- Suggestions for next steps

Advanced students who finish early can continue beyond the study plan for additional practice (up to 10 extra turns).

## Key Details

- Sessions are saved automatically — you can review past sessions in your history
- Each session focuses on one subtopic for depth over breadth
- The tutor adapts its response length to match yours — shorter responses for quiet students, more detail for expressive ones
- If the tutor detects you're disengaging (responses getting shorter), it adjusts its approach
