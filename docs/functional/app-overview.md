## UX Philosophy

The app is designed for kids. Every screen, every interaction is built to be effortless:

- **One thing per screen** — Each screen has one clear purpose with big, clear buttons
- **Minimal typing** — Pickers and selectors over free-text wherever possible
- **Friendly language** — No jargon. "What's your name?" not "Enter display name"
- **Mobile-first** — Designed for phone screens first with large tap targets
- **Warm and encouraging** — "You're all set! Let's start learning" not "Account created successfully"
- **Forgiving** — Messy input is handled gracefully. Errors are kind, not scary
- **Fast** — Nothing should feel slow. If it takes time, show progress
- **Skippable** — Optional steps have a clear "Skip for now" button
