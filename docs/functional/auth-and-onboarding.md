## Signup Flow

### Email Signup
1. Tap "Continue with Email", then "Don't have an account? Sign up"
2. Enter your email and create a password
3. Password requirements are shown as you type — at least 8 characters, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number
4. Confirm your password by typing it again
5. Check your email for a 6-digit verification code
6. Enter the code (one digit per box — it submits automatically when all 6 are filled)
7. You're signed in automatically after verification

### Phone Signup
1. Tap "Continue with Phone"
2. Pick your country code (+91 India, +1 US, +44 UK, +61 Australia)
3. Enter your phone number
4. Receive an OTP code via SMS
5. Enter the 6-digit code (one digit per box — it submits automatically when all 6 are filled)
6. You're signed in

Phone signup and login are the same flow — entering your phone number creates an account if one doesn't exist.

### Google Signup
1. Tap "Continue with Google"
2. You'll be redirected to Google to sign in
3. After signing in, you're redirected back and signed in automatically

## Email Verification

New email accounts need to verify their email address:
1. After signing up, you'll see a verification screen showing which email the code was sent to
2. Enter the 6-digit code, one digit per box — it submits automatically when all digits are filled
3. If the code doesn't arrive, wait for the cooldown timer (30 seconds) and tap "Resend code"
4. After verification, you're logged in automatically

---

## Forgot Password

1. Tap "Forgot password?" on the email login screen
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for a reset code
4. Enter the code and your new password (at least 8 characters)
5. After resetting, tap "Go to Login" to sign in with your new password

## Onboarding Wizard

First-time users go through a short onboarding flow before they can start learning:

1. **What's your name?** — Enter your first name
2. **How old are you?** — Enter your age (5-18)
3. **What grade are you in?** — Tap your grade from a grid of 1-12
4. **What's your school board?** — Tap your board (CBSE, ICSE, State Board, or Other)
5. **Tell us about yourself** — Optional free-text about interests and learning style (can be skipped with "Skip for now")
6. **You're all set!** — Confirmation screen with a "Start Learning" button

Progress dots at the top show which step you're on. Each step saves automatically — even if you leave mid-flow, your progress is kept. Onboarding is marked complete once your name, age, grade, and board are all filled in.

## Profile Management

After onboarding, you can view and update your profile from the profile page:

- **View mode** — Shows all your profile fields in read-only format, plus your sign-in method (email, phone, or Google) and account details
- **Edit mode** — Tap "Edit Profile" to make changes, then "Save Changes" to confirm or "Cancel" to discard

Editable fields:
- Name
- Age
- Grade
- Board
- School name (optional)
- About me (optional)

The profile page also has a "Log Out" button to sign out of your account.

## Key Details

- All three auth methods (phone, email, Google) lead to the same app experience
- The onboarding wizard only appears once — after completing it, you go straight to the tutor on future logins
- Profile data (grade, board) is used to personalize the tutoring experience and show relevant curriculum
- OTP and email verification codes use a 6-digit input with auto-submit — no need to tap a button after entering all digits
- Resend buttons have a 30-second cooldown to prevent spamming
