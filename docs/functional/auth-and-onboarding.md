## Signup Flow

### Email Signup

## Onboarding Wizard

First-time users go through a short onboarding flow before they can start learning:

1. **What's your name?** — Enter your first name
2. **How old are you?** — Enter your age (5-18)
3. **What grade are you in?** — Tap your grade (1-12)
4. **What board?** — Tap your board (CBSE, ICSE, State Board, or Other)
5. **Tell us about yourself** — Optional text about interests and learning style (can be skipped)
6. **You're all set!** — Confirmation screen with a "Start Learning" button

Progress dots at the top show which step you're on. Each step saves automatically — even if you leave mid-flow, your progress is kept.

## Profile Management

After onboarding, you can update your profile anytime from the user menu:

- Name
- Age
- Grade
- Board
- School name
- About me

## Key Details

- All three auth methods (phone, email, Google) lead to the same app experience
- The onboarding wizard only appears once — after completing it, you go straight to the tutor on future logins
- Profile data (grade, board) is used to personalize the tutoring experience and show relevant curriculum
- Sessions are anonymous until you sign in — signing in links sessions to your account
