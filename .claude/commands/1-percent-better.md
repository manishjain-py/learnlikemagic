- Run evaluation on Personas: Struggler and Ace (/Users/manishjain/repos/learnlikemagic/docs/EVALUATION_PIPELINE.md). Use any available topic.

- After evaluation is done, carefully review the results, and review identified problems/issues

- Deeply think about how these issues can be addressed. Keep in mind: Master tutor LLM prompt is super important and critical. Improving it is an art. We should not spoil what's working great, we can't bloat it. Come up with a well thought-through plan of what code changes can be made to improve the learning experience and hence the scores.

- Implement these code changes and verify that they are working.

- Run evaluation again on Personas: Struggler and Ace (/Users/manishjain/repos/learnlikemagic/docs/EVALUATION_PIPELINE.md). Use any available topic.

- Compare the two reports and output your final comparison report and feedback on whether the code changes work or not.
