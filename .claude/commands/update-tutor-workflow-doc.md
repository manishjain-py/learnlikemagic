Update the Tutor Workflow Pipeline documentation (SSOT).

  **Task:**
  1. Read the current documentation at: /Users/manishjain/repos/learnlikemagic/docs/features/TUTOR_WORKFLOW_PIPELINE.md
  2. Explore the actual code in these locations:
     - Frontend: llm-frontend
     - Backend: llm-backend
  3. Compare the documentation against the code to identify:
     - New features/endpoints not documented
     - Removed/deprecated code still in docs
     - Changed data models, flows, or services
     - Updated file names or locations
  4. Update the documentation to reflect the current state of the code
  5. Keep the document compact - don't repeat
  6. Make sure that the documentation is accurate and up-to-date
