# 2026-02-26

## Session Log
- Re-audited repository state on `main@973d1ea`.
- Refreshed all internal agent reference files under `.agent/` against current code.
- Updated long-term memory (`MEMORY.md`) to reflect current stable architecture facts.

## Current Snapshot
- Backend source: 203 Python files (~44,344 LOC)
- Frontend source: 51 TS/TSX files (~11,194 LOC)
- Docs: 28 markdown files
- Backend tests: 48 unit files, 8 integration files

## Confirmed Drift Notes
- Frontend README is outdated.
- Technical docs still include stale `/sessions/scorecard` references.
- Legacy `TutorState` and newer `SessionState` coexist in repository/service layer.
- Guideline schema migration cleanup remains unresolved.
- `entrypoint.sh` model log is env-based while runtime model selection is DB-based.

## Follow-up
- Keep `.agent/06-known-drift.md` updated whenever docs or APIs are aligned.
