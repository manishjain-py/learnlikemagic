# ‚úÖ DOMAIN SETUP COMPLETE!
Date: October 23, 2025

## üéâ ALL WORKING - NO ACTION NEEDED

See DOMAIN-SETUP-COMPLETE.md for full details.

Your domain is fully operational:
- https://learnlikemagic.com ‚úÖ
- https://www.learnlikemagic.com ‚úÖ

# Previous Status (for reference)

### ‚úÖ WORKING - www.learnlikemagic.com
- DNS: CNAME ‚Üí dlayb9nj2goz.cloudfront.net ‚úÖ
- SSL Certificate: Valid and issued ‚úÖ
- HTTPS: Working perfectly (HTTP/2 200 OK) ‚úÖ
- Content: Serving from CloudFront/S3 ‚úÖ
- **READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**

Test: https://www.learnlikemagic.com

### ‚ùå ISSUE - learnlikemagic.com (Root Domain)
- DNS: A records pointing to 3.33.152.147 and 15.197.142.173
- Server: AWS ELB (awselb/2.0) - GoDaddy forwarding service
- HTTP: Returns 405 Not Allowed ‚ùå
- HTTPS: Hangs/times out ‚ùå
- **NEEDS FIXING**

## Root Cause Analysis

The root domain is pointing to GoDaddy's forwarding infrastructure IPs, but the forwarding
is not configured correctly. The A records are not the right approach for CloudFront.

## Next Steps to Fix Root Domain

### Option 1: Use WWW as Primary (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)
Since www.learnlikemagic.com is already working perfectly:

1. Go to GoDaddy Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Forwarding" (NOT DNS section)
3. Set up domain forwarding:
   - From: learnlikemagic.com (or @)
   - To: https://www.learnlikemagic.com
   - Type: Permanent (301 redirect)
   - Forward only: Yes
4. Save changes
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
6. Test: curl -I http://learnlikemagic.com (should show 301 redirect)

This is a common pattern used by many websites.

### Option 2: Direct Root Domain to CloudFront (Advanced)

If you want learnlikemagic.com to work directly without redirect:

**Check if GoDaddy supports ALIAS/ANAME records:**
1. Go to GoDaddy DNS Management
2. Look for record type options
3. If you see "ALIAS" or "ANAME":
   - Delete current A records (3.33.152.147, 15.197.142.173)
   - Add ALIAS record:
     - Type: ALIAS (or ANAME)
     - Name: @ (root domain)
     - Value: dlayb9nj2goz.cloudfront.net
     - TTL: 600
   - Save and wait for propagation

**If GoDaddy doesn't support ALIAS:**
- Consider transferring DNS to AWS Route 53 (see docs/custom-domain-setup.md)
- Route 53 supports ALIAS records for root domains
- Or use Option 1 (forwarding) instead

### Option 3: Transfer DNS to Route 53 (Most Robust)

For best AWS integration:
1. See detailed instructions in docs/custom-domain-setup.md ‚Üí "Optional: Transfer DNS to Route 53"
2. Route 53 supports ALIAS records for root domains
3. Better integration with CloudFront
4. More control over DNS configuration

## Quick Verification Commands

After making changes, test with:

```bash
# Check DNS propagation
dig learnlikemagic.com A +short
dig www.learnlikemagic.com CNAME +short

# Test HTTP (should show 301 redirect if using Option 1)
curl -I http://learnlikemagic.com

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://learnlikemagic.com
curl -I https://www.learnlikemagic.com
```

## What to Check in GoDaddy

When you continue, please check and note:

1. **DNS Records** (in DNS Management):
   - What records exist for @ (root domain)?
   - What records exist for www?
   - Do you see ALIAS/ANAME as an option?

2. **Domain Forwarding** (separate section from DNS):
   - Is any forwarding currently configured?
   - What type (permanent/temporary)?

3. **Current A Records** (likely the issue):
   - You probably have A records: 3.33.152.147, 15.197.142.173
   - These need to be removed/replaced

## Resources

- Full documentation: docs/custom-domain-setup.md
- AWS CloudFront Distribution ID: E19EYV4ZGTL1L9
- CloudFront Domain: dlayb9nj2goz.cloudfront.net
- Certificate ARN: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:926211191776:certificate/f4979e52-cb3a-4188-977a-ab46279dfff0

## Important Notes

- **WWW subdomain is fully functional** - you can use this immediately
- Root domain issue is only a DNS configuration problem
- No changes needed on AWS side - CloudFront is configured correctly
- All SSL certificates are valid for both domains

## Estimated Time

- Option 1 (Forwarding): 5-15 minutes
- Option 2 (ALIAS): 10-30 minutes (if supported)
- Option 3 (Route 53): 30-60 minutes (one-time setup)

## When You Continue

1. Check GoDaddy DNS/Forwarding settings
2. Choose one of the options above
3. Make the changes in GoDaddy
4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)
5. Run verification commands
6. Update this file with results
